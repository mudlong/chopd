										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An endoscopy is a test that examines a part of the body. The endoscope is a flexible tube with a light and camera. This diagnostic tool is frequently used to examine the digestive tract. It is inserted through the mouth or rectum to examine the digestive tract. This test can be used to diagnose stomach problems, gastritis, bleeding, bowel problems, colon polyps, and much more. Colonoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to look at the inner lining of your large intestine (rectum and colon). A thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope is used to look at the colon. A colonoscopy helps find ulcers, colon polyps, and areas of inflammation or bleeding. During a colonoscopy, tissue samples can be collected and abnormal growths can be taken out. Colonoscopy can also be used as a screening test to check for cancer or precancerous growths in the colon or rectum</p>
<p>The colonoscope is a thin, flexible tube that ranges from 48 in. (125 cm) to 72 in. (183 cm) long. A small video camera is attached to it, so that your doctor can take pictures or a video of the large intestine (colon). The colonoscope can be used to look at the whole colon and the lower part of the small intestine. A sigmoidoscopy shows only the rectum and the lower part of the colon.</p>
<p><strong>PREPARING FOR A COLONOSCOPY</strong></p>
<p>Before this procedure, you will need to clean out your colon. Colon preparation takes 1 to 2 days, depending on which type of preparation your doctor recommends. Some preps may be taken the evening before the test. For many people, the bowel prep may be uncomfortable, and you may feel hungry on the clear liquid diet. Plan to stay home during your prep time since you will need to use the bathroom often. The colon preparation may cause loose, frequent stools and diarrhea so that your colon will be empty for the test.</p>
<p>Colonoscopy is one of many procedures that may be used to screen colon cancer. Others include sigmoidoscopy, stool tests, and computed tomographic colonography. Which screening test you choose depends on your risk, your preference, and your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what is best for you.</p>
<p><strong>GASTROSCOPY</strong></p>
<p>Gastroscopy is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is used to look inside the oesophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). It’s also sometimes referred to as an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The endoscope has a light and a camera</p>
<p><strong>PREPARING FOR A GASTROSCOPY</strong></p>
<p>If referred for a gastroscopy, you’ll be told whether you need to stop taking any of your medications.</p>
<p>You may need to stop taking any prescribed medicines for indigestion for up to two weeks before the procedure. This is because the medication can mask some of the problems gastroscopy could find.</p>
<p>If you are taking any of the following medications, you should phone the endoscopy unit before your appointment, because special arrangements may need to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any medication used to treat diabetes</li>
<li>Any blood-thinning medication</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that your stomach is empty during a gastroscopy, so the whole area can be seen clearly.</p>
<p>You are expected to not eat anything for six to eight hours before the procedure, and to stop drinking two to three hours before the procedure.</p>
<h6>Why it&#8217;s done</h6>
<p>Your doctor may recommend a colonoscopy to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate intestinal signs and symptoms.</strong> A colonoscopy can help your doctor explore possible causes of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, chronic constipation, chronic diarrhea and other intestinal problems.</li>
<li><strong>Screen for colon cancer.</strong> If you&#8217;re age 40 or older and at average risk of colon cancer — you have no colon cancer risk factors other than age — your doctor may recommend a colonoscopy every 10 years or sometimes sooner to screen for colon cancer. Colonoscopy is one option for colon cancer screening. Talk with your doctor about your options.</li>
<li><strong>Look for more polyps.</strong> If you have had polyps before, your doctor may recommend a follow-up colonoscopy to look for and remove any additional polyps. This is done to reduce your risk of colon cancer.</li>

<p>Nursing is a critical factor in determining the quality of care in hospitals and the nature of patient outcomes. Twenty-four-hour nursing care is one of the distinctive hallmarks of inpatient care in hospitals and Nursing personnel comprise the largest proportion of patient caregivers in a hospital.</p>
<p>The Nurses at St. Nicholas Hospital are compassionate and skilled caregivers dedicated to providing for the physical and emotional needs of our patients and families in an environment that supports professional excellence.</p>
<p>We are the first and only private hospital to date that has been accredited by the Nigerian Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council to train BNSc graduates.</p>
<p><strong>Our Nursing Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1.  Intensive Care Unit (ICU): </strong>The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at St. Nicholas Hospital provides a high standard of care 24 hours per day. It is a 6-bed facility, staffed with nurses who have special training to provide compassionate care using their skills and advanced equipment.</li>
<li><strong>2.  Medical Care: </strong>This is provided on several wards throughout the hospital and includes disorders involving the respiratory, cardiovascular, renal-urinary, neurologic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and/or musculoskeletal system. Emphasis is placed on patient care as well as safe and effective pain management.</li>
<li><strong>3.  Paediatric Care: </strong>This is provided to children from infancy, including immunization/vaccination through adolescence, and to children who present with an acute illness or injury. Parents are encouraged to participate in the ongoing care of their children.</li>
<li><strong>4.  OB/GYN and Delivery Care: </strong>This includes Ante-natal care, patients who have had a vaginal or Caesarean Section delivery, and pregnancy-related medical problems or gynaecological surgical procedures.</li>
<li><strong>5.  Surgical Services: </strong>The Surgical Services Department provides preoperative nursing care to patients of all ages on a scheduled basis Monday through Friday and on an emergency basis. The surgical patient population includes patients requiring general surgery, urology, ENT, and orthopaedic procedures.</li>

</ul>
<p>Nursing values human life and in St. Nicholas Hospital, we maintain our patient’s dignity, privacy, confidentiality and rights at all times. We practice primary care nursing which is more individualized.</p>
<p>Our nursing workforce covers all categories of nursing specialty (Accident &amp; Emergency, Paediatrics, renal, perioperative) to ensure our clients/patients get the best and quality nursing care which St. Nicholas hospital is known for.</p>
<p>To add to the above we are the first private hospital to be involved in kidney transplantation. Whether developing care plans guided by patient’s needs and preferences, educating patients and their families at discharge, doing their best to facilitate continuity of care for patients across settings and among providers, RNs make coordinated care possible.</p>

&nbsp;

<strong>Nephrology</strong> is a specialty of medicine that concerns itself with the study of kidney functions, and the treatment of kidney problems including renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation).

The Nephrology Unit aims to provide comprehensive, high quality, multidisciplinary, compassionate care in a friendly and supportive environment for people with kidney diseases and other conditions that affect or arise from the kidneys.

The Department provides a full range of renal treatments for patients with kidney disease. This includes clinics for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients with a kidney transplant and patients nearing kidney failure, using our on-site haemodialysis unit.

Kidney disease often coexists with other medical conditions such as heart disease, vascular disease and diabetes, and our team works closely with specialists from other disciplines to ensure that our patients receive the care that is appropriate to their individual health needs.
<h4 style="color: #004f84;">The treatment and specialist services we provide includes:</h4>
1. Dialysis

4. Conservative kidney management

5. General and specialist outpatient clinics for people with:

</ul>
6. Pre-kidney transplant service supported by counsellors and dietitians, to help prepare patients for transplant.

7. Kidney transplants and post kidney transplantation follow up (recipient and donor).

The first kidney transplant in West African sub-region was done at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos Nigeria on the in 6th March 2000.
With a dedicated renal transplant team we are able to give our patients with end stage renal failure, a better quality of life.
<h4 style="color: #004f84;">Our Staff</h4>
