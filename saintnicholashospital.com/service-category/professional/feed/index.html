										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dialysis</h1>
<p>The Dialysis Unit of St. Nicholas Hospital is dedicated to improving health outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dialysis is a medical procedure in which the functions of a kidney to remove metabolic waste and excess water from the body are taking over by a machine. This may be done temporarily (days or weeks) or it may be carried out over a long time (years).</p>
<p>With 15,000 new cases of kidney failure occurring every year in Nigeria and statistics showing a further 30 million Nigerians suffering from kidney disease, it is apparent that the provision of dialysis is a critical service to our clients.</p>
<p>We have the busiest privately owned dialysis unit in Lagos which we operate to international standards.</p>

<p>The primary goal is to ensure a safe procedure with the best possible therapeutic outcome. By combining the latest technology, convenient scheduling, and a compassionate staff, the Dialysis Unit of St. Nicholas Hospital strives to provide its patients with the highest quality of dialysis care.</p>
<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>We are staffed by a team of doctors, specialist nephrology nurses with extensive experience in all aspects of renal nursing, renal technicians and nutritionists. Our skilled staff work together to provide the best care possible and we emphasize compassion, comfort, and communication to ensure patients have all they need for the best possible experience.</p>
<p><strong>Our Facility</strong></p>
<p>We have 10-bed dialysis unit which is comfortable and spacious with all the equipment needed for dialysis. In addition, we have a separate dialysis unit in ICU for critically ill patients.</p>
<p><strong>Operating Hours</strong></p>
<p>Dialysis services are provided 24hrs every day at 57, Campbell Street, Lagos Island.</p>

Kidney disease often coexists with other medical conditions such as heart disease, vascular disease and diabetes, and our team works closely with specialists from other disciplines to ensure that our patients receive the care that is appropriate to their individual health needs.

The first kidney transplant in West African sub-region was done at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos Nigeria on the in 6th March 2000.
With a dedicated renal transplant team we are able to give our patients with end stage renal failure, a better quality of life.
