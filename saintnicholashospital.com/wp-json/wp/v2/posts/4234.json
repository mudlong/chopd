The exposure\nto second hand smoke caused him to develop allergies and serious infections\nthat triggered asthma attacks, eventually causing permanent lung damage called\nbronchiectasis. \u201cThe casino was filled with smoke from so many people smoking,\u201d\nhe said. Breathing in other people\u2019s smoke on a daily basis made his health so\nbad that he had to leave that job.&nbsp;<br>\nNathan used to be active and athletic. He served in the Marines. He loved to\nparticipate in tribal dances. After getting sick, dancing just a few steps wore\nhim out. Nathan hoped that sharing his story would help others understand how\ndangerous exposure to second hand smoke really is. Nathan\u2019s lung damage led to\nhis death on October 17, 2013.
