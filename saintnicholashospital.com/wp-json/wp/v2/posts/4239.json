It can also represent a loss of\nself as our memories make-up an internal biography of things we have done,\npeople we love, and much more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, much research has been done on ways people, both\nyoung and old, can sharpen their minds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From&nbsp;<em>Harvard Health Publications<\/em>&nbsp;here are a few research proven tips for a better memory:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Economize your brain use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take advantage of calendars and planners, maps, shopping lists,\nfile folders, and address books to keep routine information accessible.\nDesignate a place at home for your glasses, keys, and other items you use\nfrequently<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Organize your thoughts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New information that\u2019s broken into smaller chunks, such as the\nhyphenated sections of a phone or social security number, is easier to remember\nthan a single long list, such as financial account numbers or the name of\neveryone in a classroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Use all your senses<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more senses you use when you learn something, the more of\nyour brain will be involved in retaining the memory. For example, odours are\nfamous for conjuring memories from the distant past, especially those with\nstrong emotional content, such as visits to a cookie-baking grandparent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Repeat after me<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you want to remember something you have just heard or\nthought about, repeat it out loud. For example, if you\u2019ve just been told\nsomeone\u2019s name, use it when you speak with him or her: \u201cSo John, where did you\nmeet Paul?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Space it out<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of repeating something many times in a short period, as\nif you were cramming for an exam, re-study the essentials after increasingly\nlonger periods of time \u2014 once an hour, then every few hours, then every day.\nSpacing out periods of study is particularly valuable when you are trying to\nmaster complicated information<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Make a mnemonic<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mnemonic devices are creative ways to remember lists. They can\ntake the form of acronyms \u2014 such as the classic \u201cEvery good boy does fine,\u201d to\nremember the musical notes E, G, B, D, and F on the lines of the treble clef.\nFor older learners, a particularly helpful system is a story mnemonic \u2014 that\nis, a brief narrative in which each item cues you to remember the next one<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Challenge Yourself<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in activities that require you to concentrate and tax\nyour memory will help you maintain skills as you age. Discuss books, do\ncrossword puzzles, try new recipes, travel, and undertake projects or hobbies\nthat require skills you aren\u2019t familiar or comfortable with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adapted from Harvard Health Publications by Ladipo Eso<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Normal age-related changes in the brain tend to slow some of our cognitive processes, making it&nbsp;harder to learn new things and easier to get distracted.
