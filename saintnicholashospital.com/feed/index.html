<p>Belly fat is a common concern for many women, and it&#8217;s often the area that seems most difficult to target when trying to lose weight. Learn about the primary reasons women tend to store more fat in the abdominal region and the contributing factors, including hormonal differences, genetics, and lifestyle choices. This article will discuss the health risks associated with excess belly fat and provide effective ways to reduce it through regular exercise and dietary changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="275" height="183" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital.jpg?resize=275%2C183&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7768" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><strong>Causes of Belly Fat in Women</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hormonal differences: Women have higher levels of estrogen, which causes fat to be stored in the hips, thighs, and buttocks. However, as women age and estrogen levels decline, the body starts to store fat in the abdominal area, leading to a greater accumulation of belly fat.</li>



<li>Genetics: Some women may be predisposed to storing fat in the abdominal area due to their family history or body type.</li>



<li>Lifestyle choices: A diet high in processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can lead to an increase in belly fat, as can a sedentary lifestyle. Stress is another factor that can contribute to the accumulation of belly fat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Health Risks Associated with Excess Belly Fat</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?resize=308%2C230&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7769" width="308" height="230" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital2.jpeg?resize=770%2C577&amp;ssl=1 770w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p><strong>Solutions to Reduce Belly Fa</strong>t</p>



<ul>
<li>Engage in regular exercise, particularly strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can help to increase muscle mass and boost metabolism.</li>



<li>Make dietary changes such as eating more whole foods, reducing sugar and saturated fat intake, and increasing fiber intake to reduce belly fat.</li>



<li>Maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle changes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While there&#8217;s no one definitive answer to why women tend to gather belly fat more easily than men, several factors, including hormonal differences, genetics, and lifestyle choices, contribute to this phenomenon. However, by making lifestyle changes such as engaging in regular exercise and making dietary changes, women can take steps to reduce belly fat and maintain a healthy weight. By understanding the causes of belly fat in women and the health risks associated with excess belly fat, women can take control of their health and well-being.</p>

<p>For over 50 years we have operated and functioned by our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS”.</strong></p>



<p>What this meant and still means to us is that from the moment a patient walks through our doors, every member of staff and our patient-centric operations work together like a well-oiled machine to make the patients’ healthcare journey as pleasant and smooth as possible.</p>



<p>Despite being a leader in the Nigerian healthcare industry for half a century, we wanted to give our clients more reason to trust in the care we provide. We know and understand that hospitals are not tourist/vacation spots but what we wanted was to improve the patients’ experience regardless.</p>



<p>To this end, embarked on a mission to improve the quality of care we provide; in order to achieve this, we needed to be judged by the highest of standards (Why? Our patients deserve the best) and thus began our journey to seek for an international accreditation.</p>



<p>The relevant body to oversee our quest was <a href="https://cohsasa.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (<strong>COHSASA</strong>)</a>. With a history of being an unbiased and transparent accreditation authority in healthcare, we knew they were the right choice, especially with their motto being QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE.</p>



<p>Our journey for international accreditation began by us submitting our application in 2018. Phase 1 which commenced in March 2019 began with training and self-assessment guided by a team from COHSASA who spent a week at our facility to conduct a Baseline Survey. &nbsp;They closely observed how we executed every service we offer and evaluated each against international standards. The data was used to generate a thorough but comprehensive report, which showed how each department conformed or fell short to the standards. &nbsp;It also guided us on what had to be done to achieve compliance with the set standards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=847%2C318&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7216" width="847" height="318" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=770%2C289&amp;ssl=1 770w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>St.  Nicholas Hospital&#8217;s journey to international accreditation for quality improvement and patients&#8217; safety in healthcare</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Phase 2 required us to report data of our operations, and the COHSASA team were able to monitor the progress remotely. &nbsp;It also came with support visits as required to make sure we were fully on track; COVID 19 hampered this, as travel bans were set in countries the world over. The pandemic was an all-hands-on-deck situation as the healthcare world rallied together to fight the coronavirus which threatened our very existence.</p>



<p>The effects of <a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/2020/03/30/st-nicholas-hospital-newsletter-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealing with the pandemic</a> carried over into the 3<sup>rd</sup> and final phase of our accreditation journey. We were confident that the setbacks would at best delay the process, but our positivity and desire to provide the utmost care to our patients gave us the confidence and belief that we would achieve accreditation.</p>



<p>This final phase required a survey to be carried out by a team of unbiased surveyors that had not been previously involved with training and supporting the hospital in the quality improvement process. It was a week-long process that entailed a detailed scrutiny of every one of our processes, services, operations, records, and equipment; even the professionalism of our staff members was put to the test. It was as though our entire organization was put under the proverbial microscope. There was no hiding place for laziness, mediocrity or excuses. Our ethos and devotion to our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS” </strong>was being challenged.</p>



<p>With the guidance of our<a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/message-from-the-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MD/CEO Dr Dapo Majekodunmi,</a> his “generals”; the Executive Committee, we had the confidence we would ace these tests. Our confidence is in our shared history and experience of taking on major and otherwise seemingly impossible tasks- like successfully carrying out the first kidney transplant in sub-Saharan Africa- for which we are still a national leader after 2 decades.</p>



<p>On Friday 20<sup>th</sup> May 2022, we got the call announcing that we had passed with flying colours and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd-TAYLjQrk/">a near-perfect score of 96%</a>. This was a culmination of a 4year journey which tested our loyalty and dedication to every patient who walked in through our doors. </p>



<p>Why did we go through all of this, you wonder? Quite simple really; our dedication to healthcare is absolute and Nigerians need not travel across the seas for healthcare because <strong>QUALITY CARE ALWAYS</strong> is here in <strong>St. Nicholas Hospital</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to the safety measures put in place and to extend support to complement the [Nigerian] Government’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19, St. Nicholas Hospital has created the SAFETY PLUS FACILITY, a special unit tasked with the responsibility to curb the spread of diseases within the hospital and further treat referrals to support other private and public healthcare institutions.</p>

<p>As part of these efforts, St. Nicholas Hospital has retrofitted a fully-equipped medical unit as testing, isolation, treatment and training centre to further control infectious diseases. The St. Nicholas Hospital Safety Plus Facility is an additional 13 bedded facility located at the Maryland Branch of St. Nicholas Hospital, equipped with medical equipment, supplies and trained personnel to support patients with comorbidities. We have therefore commenced activities to serve the growing needs of the population during this critical period and after.</p>

<p>A year ago, St. Nicholas hospital became the first private hospital in Nigeria to accept graduate nurse interns and today we celebrate the 10 nurses as they have completed their program with us. We wish them greater things ahead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSC0562-1024x683.jpg?resize=847%2C565&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5521" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Here is a speech by the former CNO, Mrs Funlola Sorunke to the newly graduated interns;</p>



<p>My darling interns, this is to say many congratulations to you today, at the completion of your one year internship.<br>Though it was not easy to gain the accreditation for St. Nicholas Hospital, I have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go through the process. You see, before some of you started knocking on the hospital’s door, to be accepted for internship, I didn’t know what the whole thing was for. Actually, the fact that you have to pay to go to university for a nursing course was news to me. The chance to serve you, by gaining for you the process to become a fully fledged nurse, has been one of life’s many privileges for me. One day, when I am old, and sitting in my rocking chair, when I remember you all, it will be with a smile on my face.</p>



<p>First of all, our MD, Dr Dapo Majekodunmi should be greatly thanked and appreciated. During a time when times were hard for all hospitals, he agreed to invest in my erstwhile pursuit of “doing good for Nigeria and yourselves”. Without his generosity, this program would have been impossible.<br>Such thanks and appreciation should go to all Exco colleagues, but especially Dr Bamgboye, our Clinical Director, Ms Delice Claud-Ennin, our General Manager and Mr Diran Famakinwa, our Chief Finance Officer.<br>Remember that they all attended the welcome meeting held for you, in order to make you feel that you belong to SNH. Many were times, over the past few months, that I would go to them for guidance and advice for your matters( please clap for them).</p>



<p>It will be remiss of me if I do not give a shout-out to Matron Ojikutu and Maduemezia for their constant advice during the application for accreditation process, and for putting up with me whenever I ask them to move nurses around in order for you to be exposed to various experiences across all hospital wards.</p>



<p>Sisters Ogungbenro and Adeleye, you know I love you both dearly. Thank you for buying into my dream of what I was trying to achieve. I gave you so much to do, especially in the early stages for Sister Ogungbenro and at the latter stages, we both abandoned Sister Adeleye to finish up the work. In your own time, you visited the girls when they were on outside placements , in order to ensure that everything is well and for that I am thankful.<br>St. Nicholas Hospital is blessed with such insightful and hardworking nurses and Healthcare Assistants, who see their colleagues as family. With hindsight, I can now say that I will remember some of the disagreements with fondness.</p>



<p>As a little sideline, and to express how some silent members of staff view this internship program, Nurse Michael Agboeze bought me a present during the week you started, to thank me for getting you started, though he did not have a family member nor friend apply. How selfless is that. That is how much SNH staff show love to each other as families do.</p>



<p>Last but not least, I have to thank you all, for your perseverance. It has been a difficult year, and this new normal is sometimes painful but let’s thank God for life.<br>I am glad that none of you left halfway through the program, even when times were tough. I learnt a lot from the psychology of covid essays that I asked you to write. You are still in a better place, for now, London started another one month lockdown from yesterday and the weather is freezing cold. Hmmmmmm.</p>



<p>I hope you get your nursing licenses soon, and go out to practice what you have learnt. As I have always said to you, the patient needs is paramount every time. If they have a choice, they don’t want to meet nor need you. They should be treated with respect, even when they are being difficult. I am not saying that you should accept abuse, but with experience and time, you will learn how to deal with difficult situations and persons.</p>



<p>Go out and proclaim St. Nicholas Hospital’s name with pride and let your attitude and behaviour show that you have worked in a hospital with high predigree.</p>



<p>God bless you and yours, and may your future be bright.</p>



<p>Funlola M. Sorunke<br>Former CNO.</p>



<p>QUALITY CARE ALWAYS</p>
