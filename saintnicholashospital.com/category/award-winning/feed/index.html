<p>For over 50 years we have operated and functioned by our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS”.</strong></p>



<p>What this meant and still means to us is that from the moment a patient walks through our doors, every member of staff and our patient-centric operations work together like a well-oiled machine to make the patients’ healthcare journey as pleasant and smooth as possible.</p>



<p>Despite being a leader in the Nigerian healthcare industry for half a century, we wanted to give our clients more reason to trust in the care we provide. We know and understand that hospitals are not tourist/vacation spots but what we wanted was to improve the patients’ experience regardless.</p>



<p>To this end, embarked on a mission to improve the quality of care we provide; in order to achieve this, we needed to be judged by the highest of standards (Why? Our patients deserve the best) and thus began our journey to seek for an international accreditation.</p>



<p>The relevant body to oversee our quest was <a href="https://cohsasa.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (<strong>COHSASA</strong>)</a>. With a history of being an unbiased and transparent accreditation authority in healthcare, we knew they were the right choice, especially with their motto being QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE.</p>



<p>Our journey for international accreditation began by us submitting our application in 2018. Phase 1 which commenced in March 2019 began with training and self-assessment guided by a team from COHSASA who spent a week at our facility to conduct a Baseline Survey. &nbsp;They closely observed how we executed every service we offer and evaluated each against international standards. The data was used to generate a thorough but comprehensive report, which showed how each department conformed or fell short to the standards. &nbsp;It also guided us on what had to be done to achieve compliance with the set standards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=847%2C318&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7216" width="847" height="318" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=770%2C289&amp;ssl=1 770w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>St.  Nicholas Hospital&#8217;s journey to international accreditation for quality improvement and patients&#8217; safety in healthcare</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Phase 2 required us to report data of our operations, and the COHSASA team were able to monitor the progress remotely. &nbsp;It also came with support visits as required to make sure we were fully on track; COVID 19 hampered this, as travel bans were set in countries the world over. The pandemic was an all-hands-on-deck situation as the healthcare world rallied together to fight the coronavirus which threatened our very existence.</p>



<p>The effects of <a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/2020/03/30/st-nicholas-hospital-newsletter-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealing with the pandemic</a> carried over into the 3<sup>rd</sup> and final phase of our accreditation journey. We were confident that the setbacks would at best delay the process, but our positivity and desire to provide the utmost care to our patients gave us the confidence and belief that we would achieve accreditation.</p>



<p>This final phase required a survey to be carried out by a team of unbiased surveyors that had not been previously involved with training and supporting the hospital in the quality improvement process. It was a week-long process that entailed a detailed scrutiny of every one of our processes, services, operations, records, and equipment; even the professionalism of our staff members was put to the test. It was as though our entire organization was put under the proverbial microscope. There was no hiding place for laziness, mediocrity or excuses. Our ethos and devotion to our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS” </strong>was being challenged.</p>



<p>With the guidance of our<a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/message-from-the-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MD/CEO Dr Dapo Majekodunmi,</a> his “generals”; the Executive Committee, we had the confidence we would ace these tests. Our confidence is in our shared history and experience of taking on major and otherwise seemingly impossible tasks- like successfully carrying out the first kidney transplant in sub-Saharan Africa- for which we are still a national leader after 2 decades.</p>



<p>On Friday 20<sup>th</sup> May 2022, we got the call announcing that we had passed with flying colours and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd-TAYLjQrk/">a near-perfect score of 96%</a>. This was a culmination of a 4year journey which tested our loyalty and dedication to every patient who walked in through our doors. </p>



<p>Why did we go through all of this, you wonder? Quite simple really; our dedication to healthcare is absolute and Nigerians need not travel across the seas for healthcare because <strong>QUALITY CARE ALWAYS</strong> is here in <strong>St. Nicholas Hospital</strong>.</p>

<p>The Quad screen is a blood test that gives a woman useful information about her pregnancy. The quad screen is used to evaluate whether the pregnancy has an increased chance of being affected with certain conditions, such as Down syndrome or neural tube defects. If the risk is low, the quad screen can offer reassurance that there is a decreased chance for Down syndrome, trisomy 18, neural tube defects and abdominal wall defects. </p>

<p><strong>Is the Quad screen
not the same as my usual Ante-natal test?</strong>The screen is essentially the same as other medical screening
tests that look for other relevant substances, except the likelihood of
identifying pregnancies at risk for Down syndrome is higher through the
evaluation of Inhibin-A levels. <strong><em>Inhibin-A</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>inhibin-A</em>&nbsp;is
a protein produced by the placenta and ovaries. The Quad test determines a
mother’s risk for having a baby with Down syndrome.</p>



<p>The Quad screen test measures levels of four substances in
pregnant women&#8217;s blood:</p>



<ul><li>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (a protein made by the developing baby)</li><li>Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (a hormone made by the placenta)</li><li>Estriol  (a hormone made by the placenta and the baby&#8217;s liver)</li><li>Inhibin A, (another hormone made by the placenta)</li></ul>



<p>The test is done between weeks 15 and up to week 22.</p>



<p><strong>Why is the Quad
screen done?</strong></p>



<p>The quad screen evaluates your chance of carrying a baby who
has any of the following conditions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Down  syndrome (trisomy 21).</strong>&nbsp;Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder      that causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays and,      in some people, health problems.</li><li><strong>Trisomy 18.</strong>&nbsp;This is a chromosomal disorder that causes severe      developmental delays and abnormalities in the structure of the body.      Trisomy 18 is often fatal by age 1.</li><li><strong>Spina bifida.</strong>&nbsp;Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when a portion      of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in      the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.</li><li><strong>Abdominal wall defects.</strong>&nbsp;In these birth defects, the baby&#8217;s intestines or      other abdominal organs stick through the belly button.</li></ul>



<p>The quad screen has traditionally been one of the most
commonly used screenings in the second trimester. It was generally used if
prenatal care began during the second trimester or if first trimester
screening, which involves a blood test and an ultrasound exam, wasn&#8217;t
available.</p>



<p>A negative quad screen doesn&#8217;t guarantee that the baby won&#8217;t
have a chromosomal abnormality, single-gene disorder or certain birth defects.
If your screening test is positive, your doctor will recommend additional
testing to make a diagnosis.</p>



<p>Before the screening, think about what the results mean to
you. Consider whether the screening will be worth any anxiety it might cause,
or whether you&#8217;ll handle your pregnancy differently depending on the results. </p>



<p><strong>When should a Quad screen be done?</strong></p>



<p>The Quad screen may be offered to the expectant mother by
the obstetrician/gynaecologist between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, counting
from the first day of the last menstrual period.</p>



<p><strong>How is a Quad screen &nbsp;it done?</strong></p>



<p>You can eat and drink normally before the test.</p>



<p>During the Quad screen test, a sample of blood is taken from the woman&#8217;s vein. The blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis. </p>



<p>You can return to your usual activities immediately.</p>



<p>Substances in the blood sample are measured to screen for:</p>



<ul><li>Problems in the development of the fetus&#8217; brain, spinal cord and other neural tissues of the central nervous system (neural tube). Problems with neural tube development can occur as spina bifida or anencephaly (absence of all or part of the brain). Neural tube defects occur in 1 or 2 out of every 1000 births. The quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% of open neural tube defects.</li><li>Genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality. Approximately 1 in 720 babies is born with Down syndrome. The quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% of Down syndrome cases in women under age 35 and 85 to 90% of Down syndrome cases in women age 35 years and older.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Do I need to have the Quad screen test?</strong></p>



<p>All pregnant women are recommended to have a quad marker screen, but it is your decision whether or not to have the test. However, if you have any of the following risk factors, you may want to strongly consider having the test:</p>



<ul><li>You are age 35 or older when the baby is due.</li><li>Your family has a history of birth defects.</li><li>You&#8217;ve had a child with a previous birth defect.</li><li>You have had insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes prior to your pregnancy.</li></ul>



<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this test,
please talk with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>



<p>The quad screen is a routine prenatal screening test. The test poses no risk of miscarriage or other pregnancy complications.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>Your age and results of the quad screen will be used at the estimated time of delivery to evaluate your chance of carrying a baby who has certain chromosomal conditions, neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects.</p>



<p><strong>Factors that can affect the substances measured by a quad screen include:</strong></p>



<ul><li>A  miscalculation of how long you&#8217;ve been pregnant</li><li>Maternal race</li><li>Maternal  weight</li><li>Carrying  more than one baby during a pregnancy</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>In vitro fertilization</li><li>Smoking  during pregnancy</li></ul>



<p>The quad screen correctly identifies about 80 percent of
women who are carrying a baby who has Down syndrome. The quad screen only indicates your overall chance of
carrying a baby who has certain chromosomal conditions, neural tube defects or
abdominal wall defects. A decreased chance (negative screen result) doesn&#8217;t
guarantee that your baby won&#8217;t have one of these conditions. Likewise, an
increased chance (positive screen result) doesn&#8217;t guarantee that your baby will
be born with one of these conditions.The doctor will help you understand your test results and
what the results might mean for your pregnancy.</p>



<p><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></p>



<p><strong>What it looks for</strong></p>



<ul><li>Down syndrome</li><li>Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome)</li><li>Open Neural Tube Defects (ONTD)</li></ul>



<p><strong>When to do it</strong></p>



<ul><li>15
     weeks, 1 day to 21 weeks, 6 days gestation</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>PREVENTION: Prevention efforts include banning every toxic
types of OP. Among those who work with pesticides the use of protective
clothing and showering before going home is also useful. </p>



<p>General measures such
as&nbsp;oxygen&nbsp;and&nbsp;intravenous fluids&nbsp;are also recommended.
Attempts to decontaminate the stomach, with&nbsp;activated charcoal&nbsp;or
other means, has not been shown to be useful.&nbsp;While there is a theoretical
risk of health care workers taking care of a poisoned person becoming poisoned
themselves, the degree of risk appears to be very small. </p>



<p>TREATMENT: Treatment begins with decontamination. Airway
control and oxygenation are paramount. The mainstays of pharmacological therapy
include atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam). Initial
management must focus on adequate use of atropine. Optimizing oxygenation prior
to the use of atropine is recommended to minimize the potential for
dysrhythmias.</p>



<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Signs and symptoms of OP poisoning can be divided into three broad categories: (1) Muscarinic effects, (2) Nicotinic effects, and (3) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects. Symptoms of exposure which typically appear within 30 to 90 minutes after exposures are due to the continuous stimulation of the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.  </p>



<p>Muscarinic symptoms include excessive secretion from mucus
membranes, increased pulmonary and oropharnygeal secretions, pupillary
constriction manifesting as diarrhoea, excessive urination, miosis, bronchorrhea,
bradycardia, emesis, lacrimation and salivation, commonly tagged with the
mnemonic ‘DUMBBELS’. Adrenal medulla activity manifest as increased sweating
and garlic smell because of vicarious excretion, bradycardia, abdominal
cramping and intestinal hypermotility. </p>



<p>Nicotinic activity results in autonomic nervous system
stimulation manifesting as tachycardia, hypertension, sweating and rarely
dilated pupil. Nicotinic overstimulation at the neuromuscular junction causes
muscle weakness, fasciculation, fatigue and paralysis </p>



<p>OP toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Diagnosis is typically
based on the symptoms and can be confirmed by measuring butyrylcholinesterase
activity in the blood; but typically, these results are not readily available. </p>



<p>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: The underlying mechanism involves the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), leading to the buildup of acetylcholine (ACh) in the body. AChE is an enzyme that degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into choline and acetic acid. ACh is found in the central and peripheral nervous system, neuromuscular junctions, and red blood cells (RBCs). </p>



<p>OP can be absorbed cutaneously, ingested, inhaled, or
injected. Although most patients rapidly become symptomatic, the onset and
severity of symptoms depend on the specific compound, amount, route of
exposure, and rate of metabolic degradation.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;MANAGEMENT OF OP POISONING DECONTAMINATION: </strong>The
first step in the management of patients with organophosphate poisoning is
putting on personal protective equipment. These patients may still have the
compound on them, and you must protect yourself from exposure. Health care
providers must avoid contaminating themselves while handling patients. Use
personal protective equipment, such as neoprene gloves and gowns, when decontaminating
patients because hydrocarbons can penetrate nonpolar substances such as latex
and vinyl. Use charcoal cartridge masks for respiratory protection when
decontaminating patients who are significantly contaminated. </p>



<p>Secondly, you must decontaminate the patient. This means
removing and destroying all clothing because it may be contaminated&nbsp;even
after washing. Gently cleanse patients suspected of organophosphate exposure
with soap and water because organophosphates are hydrolyzed readily in aqueous
solutions with a high pH. </p>



<p>Irrigate the eyes of patients who have had ocular exposure
using isotonic sodium chloride solution or lactated Ringer&#8217;s solution. </p>



<p>In the case of ingestion, vomiting and diarrhea may limit
the amount of substance absorbed but should never be induced. Activated
charcoal can be given if the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion, but
studies have not shown a benefit.&nbsp; </p>



<p>MEDICAL CARE: Airway control and adequate oxygenation are paramount in organophosphate (op) poisonings. Intubation may be necessary in cases of respiratory distress due to laryngospasm, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, or seizures. Immediate aggressive use of atropine may eliminate the need for intubation. Succinylcholine should be avoided because it is degraded by plasma cholinesterase and may result in prolonged paralysis. In addition to atropine, pralidoxime and benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) are mainstays of medical therapy .   The definitive treatment for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which competes with acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors. The initial dose for adults is 2 to 5 mg IV or 0.05 mg/kg IV for children until reaching the adult dose. If the patient does not respond to the treatment, double the dose every 3 to 5 minutes until respiratory secretions have cleared and there is no bronchoconstriction. In patients with severe poisoning, it may take hundreds of milligrams of atropine given in bolus or continuous infusion over several days before the patient improves. </p>



<p>Pralidoxime&nbsp;also&nbsp;should be given to affect the
nicotinic receptors since atropine only works on muscarinic receptors. Atropine
must be given before pralidoxime to avoid worsening of muscarinic-mediated
symptoms. A bolus of at least 30 mg/kg in adults or 20 to 50 mg/kg for children
should be given over 30 minutes. Rapid administration can cause cardiac arrest.
After the bolus, a continuous infusion of at least 8 mg/kg/hr for adults and 10
to 20 mg/kg/hr for children should be started and may be needed for several
days. Central venous access and arterial lines may be needed to treat the
patient with organophosphate toxicity who requires multiple medications and
blood-gas measurements. &nbsp; Continuous cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry
should be established; an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed. Torsades
de pointes should be treated in the standard manner. The use of intravenous
magnesium sulfate has been reported as beneficial for organophosphate toxicity.
The mechanism of action may involve acetylcholine antagonism or ventricular
membrane stabilization. </p>



<p>SURGICAL CARE: Patients with trauma or blast injury should be treated according to standard advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. Patient decontamination should always be considered to prevent medical personnel poisoning. </p>



<p>INPATIENT CARE: Because of risks of respiratory compromise or recurrent symptoms, hospitalizing all symptomatic patients for at least 48 hours in a high acuity setting is recommended. Patients who are asymptomatic 12 hours after organophosphate exposure can be discharged since symptom onset should usually occur within this time frame.   Optimal recommendations are made on a case-by-case scenario.   Following occupational exposure, patients should not be allowed to return to work with organophosphates until serum cholinesterase activity returns to 75% of the known baseline level. Also, establishing baseline cholinesterase levels for workers with known organophosphate exposure is recommended </p>



<p>It is vital that health care providers working at primary and secondary level facilities should be informed of the hazards, clinical presentation of accidental organophosphate poisoning in children, and the key steps in its management.</p>

<p>Being overweight could come with lots health complications such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, gout, breathing troubles such as sleep apnea etc. Overweight could be cut down through proper dieting. Here are some few foods that can help you lose weight. </p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Beans.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="280" height="168" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/beans.jpg?resize=280%2C168" alt="" class="wp-image-4435" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="http://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/baked-beans.jpg"></a>You’ve probably never
heard of cholecystokinin, but it’s one of your best weight-loss pals. This
digestive hormone is a natural appetite suppressant. So how do you get more
cholecystokinin? One way, report researchers at the University of California at
Davis, is by eating beans: A study of eight men found that their levels of the hormone
(which may work by keeping food in your stomach longer) were twice as high
after a meal containing beans than after a low-fiber meal containing rice and
dry milk.</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Salad.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="280" height="186" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/salad.jpg?resize=280%2C186" alt="" class="wp-image-4436" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="http://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/salad_platter021.jpg"></a>Do you tend to stuff
yourself at meals? Control that calorie intake by starting with a large salad
(but hold the creamy dressing.) A study published in the Journal of the
American Dietetic Association found that people who ate one salad a day with
dressing had higher levels of vitamins C and E, folic acid, lycopene, and
carotenoids-all disease fighters-than those who didn’t add salad to their daily
menu.</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Green tea</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="265" height="176" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/green-tea.jpg?resize=265%2C176" alt="" class="wp-image-4437" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="http://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/green-tea.jpg"></a>The slimming
ingredient isn’t caffeine. Antioxidants called catechins are what help speed
metabolism and fat burning. In a recent Japanese study, 35 men who drank a
bottle of oolong tea mixed with green tea catechins lost weight, boosted their
metabolism, and had a significant drop in their body mass index. Health bonus:
The participants also lowered their (bad) LDL cholesterol.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Olive oil.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="240" height="203" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/olive-oil.jpg?resize=240%2C203" alt="" class="wp-image-4438" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="http://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/olive-oil.jpg"></a>Fight off middle-age
pounds with extra virgin olive oil. A monounsaturated fat, it’ll help you burn
calories. In an Australian study, 12 postmenopausal women (ages 57 to 73) were
given a breakfast cereal dressed either with a mixture of cream and skim milk
or half an ounce of olive oil and skim milk. The women who ate the oil-laced
muesli boosted their metabolism.</p>



<p><strong>5.
Grapefruit</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="284" height="186" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/grape-fruit.jpg?resize=284%2C186" alt="" class="wp-image-4439" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="http://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/grapefruit.jpg"></a></p>



<p> It’s back! A  2006 study of 91 obese people conducted at the Nutrition and Metabolic Research Center at Scripps Clinic found that eating half a grapefruit before each meal or drinking a serving of the juice three times a day helped people drop more than three pounds over 12 weeks.

<p>ORGANOPHOSPHATE POISONING (OP) Organophosphate
poisoning&nbsp;is&nbsp;poisoning&nbsp;due to&nbsp;organophosphates (OPs). There
are nearly 3 million poisonings per year resulting in two hundred thousand
deaths. Around 15% of people who are poisoned die as a result.&nbsp;Organophosphate
poisoning has been reported at least since 1962. </p>



<p>While most often the exposure occurs from an agricultural
pesticide, there are household items, such as ant and roach spray, that also
contain organophosphate compounds. Organophosphate pesticides are one of the
top causes of poisoning worldwide, with an annual incidence of poisonings among
agricultural workers varying from 3-10% per country. </p>



<p>Organophosphate insecticides are common household products
in Nigeria, where they are used mainly to control mosquitoes and other household
pests such as cockroaches and bed bugs. More than 80% of the reported toxic
exposures to insecticides are attributable to organophosphates. </p>



<p>The prevalence of accidental childhood poisoning across
different countries ranges from 0.74% &#8211; 7.2% of paediatric admissions with
organophosphate poisoning accounting for 7.5%-34.6% of cases of accidental
childhood poisoning in Nigeria. </p>



<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that pesticide
poisoning is now the most common method of suicide worldwide. About two million
people attempt suicide and one million accidental poisoning cases occur each
year worldwide. </p>



<p>In Nigeria, suicide is traditionally a taboo. However, the
recent report of cases of intentional poisoning is probably as a result of
media influence or breakdown of our traditional social fabric. A ten-year
retrospective study of childhood poisoning in Warri, South-south Nigeria, noted
that intentional poisoning occurred in the adolescent age group and mainly
involved female teenagers. Organophosphates were observed to be the sole agent
for intentional poisoning in the retrospective review of cases seen in
North-central Nigeria and these were adolescent females. </p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS ORGANOPHOSPHATES </strong>(OP)? Organophosphate (OP) compounds are a diverse group of chemicals used in both domestic and industrial settings. They are often constituents of pesticides and insecticides. Some of these products are produced in an unregulated manner and sold by unregistered vendors on the streets and in market places in sub-Saharan Africa. When purchased, and improperly stored, children may easily have access to, and inadvertently consume them. Indeed, globally, organophosphate poisoning is the most significant cause of severe toxicity and mortality resulting from acute poisoning.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Examples of organophosphates include the following:
Insecticides – Malathion, parathion, diazinon, fenthion, dichlorvos,
chlorpyrifos, ethion. Nerve gases – Soman, sarin, tabun, VX. Ophthalmic agents
– Echothiophate, isoflurophate. Antihelmintics – Trichlorfon. Herbicides –
Tribufos (DEF), merphos. Industrial chemical (plasticizer) – Tricresyl
phosphate. </p>



<p>The most popular source of organophosphate
insecticide/pesticide in Nigeria is the locally made variety called
‘Otapiapia’. The main active ingredient in ‘otapiapia’ is dichlorvos or 2,
2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP), and are readily available for
purchase on the streets. ‘Sniper’, which is another common variety of DDVP has
a more refined packaging and is available in stores nationwide at a higher cost.
</p>



<p>OP poisoning occurs most commonly as
a&nbsp;suicide&nbsp;attempt in farming areas of the&nbsp;developing
world&nbsp;and less commonly by accident. &nbsp;Exposure can be from drinking,
breathing in the vapors, or skin exposure. &nbsp; </p>



<p>Cheap locally-made preparations of organophosphates are
widely available and unregulated in low income settings such as in Nigeria.
These preparations are stored at home in old soft drink or juice containers
which attract unsuspecting children resulting in unintentional poisoning. </p>



<p>Sniper, is marketed in Nigeria by Swiss-Nigerian Chemical
Company, as a synthetic organophosphorus but which many Nigerians have
converted to an indoor insecticide. There have been cases of sniper poisonong
in Nigeria; a 400-level student of the Department of English and Literary
Studies,&nbsp;University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), allegedly&nbsp;drank two
bottles of Sniper insecticide leading to his death on Tuesday, May 14, 2019.
Friends said he had a long battle with depression before his death.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Other cases are&nbsp;A Niger Delta University student, who
committed suicide by drinking Sniper after he discovered he had ‘carryover’ in
his courses. This came shortly after two female students of University of Lagos
were reported to have killed themselves using the insecticide following the accusations
that they stole clothes in their hostel. Another 32-year-old banker and mother
of two in Delta State, committed suicide over her husband’s alleged infidelity.
She also took Sniper.</p>



<p><strong>MORTALITY/MORBIDITY</strong>:  Worldwide mortality studies report mortality rates from 3-25%. The compounds most frequently involved include malathion, dichlorvos, trichlorfon, and fenitrothion/malathion. &nbsp; Mortality rates depend on the type of compound used, amount ingested, general health of the patient, delay in discovery and transport, insufficient respiratory management, delay in intubation, and failure in weaning off ventilatory support. &nbsp; Complications include severe bronchorrhea, seizures, weakness, and neuropathy. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. </p>

<p>Ewedu soup is a traditional Nigerian recipe mostly eaten by the Yoruba people, but is now a favourite of most other ethnic groups. Ewedu also known as<em>&nbsp;Corchorus</em>&nbsp;is a genus of about 40-100 species of flowering plants in the family&nbsp;<em>Malvaceae</em>, native to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Do you know that:</em></h1>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Ewedu is called Rama in Hausa, malukhiyah in Egypt, molohiya in Isreal, krain krain in Sierra Loene and mrenda in Kenya.</em><em>Ewedu is used to produce soup (taushe) or mixed with kuli kuli (groundnut cake) to form a dish known as kwado in Hausa.</em><em>&nbsp;Ewedu is good for weight loss because of its low calorific content and it helps strengthen the immune system, fights off stress and heart disease.</em></h6>



<p>Ewedu is a folk remedy for aches and pains, dysentery, enteritis, fever, dysentery, pectoral pains, and tumors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ewedu.jpg?resize=226%2C166" alt="" class="wp-image-4333" width="226" height="166" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>ewedu and okra</figcaption></figure>



<p> This green, leafy vegetable is rich in beta-carotene for good eyesight, iron for healthy red<br>blood cells, calcium for strong bones and teeth, and vitamin C for smooth, clear skin,<br>strong immune cells, and fast wound-healing. Vitamins A, C and E present in Ewedu<br>“sponge-up” free radicals, scooping them up before they can commit cellular sabotage.</p>



<p>One-half cup cooked Ewedu leaves contains: 1.3g protein, 0.3g fat, 3.1g carbohydrates,<br>0.4g fiber, 87.3mg calcium, 22.5mg phosphorous, 1.0mg iron, 0.02mg thiamine, 0.04mg riboflavin, 0.3mg niacin, and 10mg Ascorbic Acid or vitamin C. Ewedu has an antioxidant activity of 77%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Diarrhoea and respiratory infections remain leading killers of young children in the developing world, and claim approximately 3.5 million young lives each year. The centre for disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been studying the role of handwashing in preventing these diseases in developing world settings. In a series of randomized, controlled studies of intensive handwashing promotion in Pakistan, CDC researchers found about 50% fewer diarrheal and respiratory infections among young children in low-income households that received weekly handwashing promotion and a supply of soap for about a year, compared with households that did not receive these interventions. The disease reductions were similar whether households were given antibacterial or plain soap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="300" height="199" src="https://i0.wp.com/s805784321.onlinehome.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handwashing.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" class="wp-image-4301" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/handwashing-1.jpg"></a>These studies helped demonstrate that handwashing can prevent spread of two of the leading killers of young children in the developing world. However, although handwashing seems outwardly simple, the habit of washing hands consistently and at the key times can be difficult to form. Additionally, handwashing does require some basic infrastructure: a water source and a hand cleanser like soap, ideally placed somewhere convenient to access during the most important times to wash hands, such as after using the toilet and before preparing or eating food. Establishing and maintaining such infrastructure may be challenging in some settings. Thus, while the type of intensive handwashing promotion used in these studies can be very effective in reducing disease, it is probably not something that can be delivered efficiently to large numbers of people. Furthermore, it is unclear whether handwashing behaviour change or health impacts are sustained after such promotion ends.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4302" width="228" height="304" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?resize=600%2C800&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/group-hand-washing.jpg?resize=770%2C1027&amp;ssl=1 770w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://stnicholashospitallagos.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/images-1.jpg"></a>As a result, CDC began investigating models of promoting
handwashing behaviour change more efficiently in developing countries. Because
hygiene habits generally evolve through childhood, and large numbers of
children are concentrated in schools, this strategy included studying schools
as a site for handwashing promotion. In one randomized, controlled study,
investigators compared absenteeism among three groups of first grade students
for 5 months in China. One group was exposed to a simple, commercially-developed
handwashing promotion program; a second group received the same program, plus a
supply of soap for the school sinks, and one child in each classroom served as
a handwashing role model for his or her peers; the third group received hygiene
education that was typical for the region. Students in the group that received
the handwashing promotion program, soap, and peer hygiene role models were
absent substantially less than students who continued to receive standard
hygiene education.</p>



<p>Additional research is underway to further clarify the role of school-based handwashing promotion in reducing illness among students and their families in several countries, and to explore the long-term impacts on child development of intensive handwashing promotion.</p>
