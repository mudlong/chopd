<p>Belly fat is a common concern for many women, and it&#8217;s often the area that seems most difficult to target when trying to lose weight. Learn about the primary reasons women tend to store more fat in the abdominal region and the contributing factors, including hormonal differences, genetics, and lifestyle choices. This article will discuss the health risks associated with excess belly fat and provide effective ways to reduce it through regular exercise and dietary changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="275" height="183" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/belly-fat-in-women-st-nicholas-hosital.jpg?resize=275%2C183&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7768" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><strong>Causes of Belly Fat in Women</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hormonal differences: Women have higher levels of estrogen, which causes fat to be stored in the hips, thighs, and buttocks. However, as women age and estrogen levels decline, the body starts to store fat in the abdominal area, leading to a greater accumulation of belly fat.</li>



<li>Genetics: Some women may be predisposed to storing fat in the abdominal area due to their family history or body type.</li>



<li>Lifestyle choices: A diet high in processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can lead to an increase in belly fat, as can a sedentary lifestyle. Stress is another factor that can contribute to the accumulation of belly fat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Health Risks Associated with Excess Belly Fat</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solutions to Reduce Belly Fa</strong>t</p>



<ul>
<li>Engage in regular exercise, particularly strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can help to increase muscle mass and boost metabolism.</li>



<li>Make dietary changes such as eating more whole foods, reducing sugar and saturated fat intake, and increasing fiber intake to reduce belly fat.</li>



<li>Maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle changes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While there&#8217;s no one definitive answer to why women tend to gather belly fat more easily than men, several factors, including hormonal differences, genetics, and lifestyle choices, contribute to this phenomenon. However, by making lifestyle changes such as engaging in regular exercise and making dietary changes, women can take steps to reduce belly fat and maintain a healthy weight. By understanding the causes of belly fat in women and the health risks associated with excess belly fat, women can take control of their health and well-being.</p>

<p>For over 50 years we have operated and functioned by our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS”.</strong></p>



<p>What this meant and still means to us is that from the moment a patient walks through our doors, every member of staff and our patient-centric operations work together like a well-oiled machine to make the patients’ healthcare journey as pleasant and smooth as possible.</p>



<p>Despite being a leader in the Nigerian healthcare industry for half a century, we wanted to give our clients more reason to trust in the care we provide. We know and understand that hospitals are not tourist/vacation spots but what we wanted was to improve the patients’ experience regardless.</p>



<p>To this end, embarked on a mission to improve the quality of care we provide; in order to achieve this, we needed to be judged by the highest of standards (Why? Our patients deserve the best) and thus began our journey to seek for an international accreditation.</p>



<p>The relevant body to oversee our quest was <a href="https://cohsasa.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (<strong>COHSASA</strong>)</a>. With a history of being an unbiased and transparent accreditation authority in healthcare, we knew they were the right choice, especially with their motto being QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE.</p>



<p>Our journey for international accreditation began by us submitting our application in 2018. Phase 1 which commenced in March 2019 began with training and self-assessment guided by a team from COHSASA who spent a week at our facility to conduct a Baseline Survey. &nbsp;They closely observed how we executed every service we offer and evaluated each against international standards. The data was used to generate a thorough but comprehensive report, which showed how each department conformed or fell short to the standards. &nbsp;It also guided us on what had to be done to achieve compliance with the set standards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=847%2C318&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7216" width="847" height="318" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?resize=770%2C289&amp;ssl=1 770w, https://i0.wp.com/saintnicholashospital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/St.-Nicholas-Hospital-accredited-international-by-COHSASA-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>St.  Nicholas Hospital&#8217;s journey to international accreditation for quality improvement and patients&#8217; safety in healthcare</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Phase 2 required us to report data of our operations, and the COHSASA team were able to monitor the progress remotely. &nbsp;It also came with support visits as required to make sure we were fully on track; COVID 19 hampered this, as travel bans were set in countries the world over. The pandemic was an all-hands-on-deck situation as the healthcare world rallied together to fight the coronavirus which threatened our very existence.</p>



<p>The effects of <a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/2020/03/30/st-nicholas-hospital-newsletter-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealing with the pandemic</a> carried over into the 3<sup>rd</sup> and final phase of our accreditation journey. We were confident that the setbacks would at best delay the process, but our positivity and desire to provide the utmost care to our patients gave us the confidence and belief that we would achieve accreditation.</p>



<p>This final phase required a survey to be carried out by a team of unbiased surveyors that had not been previously involved with training and supporting the hospital in the quality improvement process. It was a week-long process that entailed a detailed scrutiny of every one of our processes, services, operations, records, and equipment; even the professionalism of our staff members was put to the test. It was as though our entire organization was put under the proverbial microscope. There was no hiding place for laziness, mediocrity or excuses. Our ethos and devotion to our mantra <strong>“QUALITY CARE ALWAYS” </strong>was being challenged.</p>



<p>With the guidance of our<a href="https://saintnicholashospital.com/message-from-the-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MD/CEO Dr Dapo Majekodunmi,</a> his “generals”; the Executive Committee, we had the confidence we would ace these tests. Our confidence is in our shared history and experience of taking on major and otherwise seemingly impossible tasks- like successfully carrying out the first kidney transplant in sub-Saharan Africa- for which we are still a national leader after 2 decades.</p>



<p>On Friday 20<sup>th</sup> May 2022, we got the call announcing that we had passed with flying colours and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd-TAYLjQrk/">a near-perfect score of 96%</a>. This was a culmination of a 4year journey which tested our loyalty and dedication to every patient who walked in through our doors. </p>



<p>Why did we go through all of this, you wonder? Quite simple really; our dedication to healthcare is absolute and Nigerians need not travel across the seas for healthcare because <strong>QUALITY CARE ALWAYS</strong> is here in <strong>St. Nicholas Hospital</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to the safety measures put in place and to extend support to complement the [Nigerian] Government’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19, St. Nicholas Hospital has created the SAFETY PLUS FACILITY, a special unit tasked with the responsibility to curb the spread of diseases within the hospital and further treat referrals to support other private and public healthcare institutions.</p>

<p>As part of these efforts, St. Nicholas Hospital has retrofitted a fully-equipped medical unit as testing, isolation, treatment and training centre to further control infectious diseases. The St. Nicholas Hospital Safety Plus Facility is an additional 13 bedded facility located at the Maryland Branch of St. Nicholas Hospital, equipped with medical equipment, supplies and trained personnel to support patients with comorbidities. We have therefore commenced activities to serve the growing needs of the population during this critical period and after.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Quad screen
not the same as my usual Ante-natal test?</strong>The screen is essentially the same as other medical screening
tests that look for other relevant substances, except the likelihood of
identifying pregnancies at risk for Down syndrome is higher through the
evaluation of Inhibin-A levels. <strong><em>Inhibin-A</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>inhibin-A</em>&nbsp;is
a protein produced by the placenta and ovaries. The Quad test determines a
mother’s risk for having a baby with Down syndrome.</p>



<p>The Quad screen test measures levels of four substances in
pregnant women&#8217;s blood:</p>



<ul><li>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (a protein made by the developing baby)</li><li>Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (a hormone made by the placenta)</li><li>Estriol  (a hormone made by the placenta and the baby&#8217;s liver)</li><li>Inhibin A, (another hormone made by the placenta)</li></ul>



<p>The test is done between weeks 15 and up to week 22.</p>



<p><strong>Why is the Quad
screen done?</strong></p>



<p>The quad screen evaluates your chance of carrying a baby who
has any of the following conditions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Down  syndrome (trisomy 21).</strong>&nbsp;Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder      that causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays and,      in some people, health problems.</li><li><strong>Trisomy 18.</strong>&nbsp;This is a chromosomal disorder that causes severe      developmental delays and abnormalities in the structure of the body.      Trisomy 18 is often fatal by age 1.</li><li><strong>Spina bifida.</strong>&nbsp;Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when a portion      of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in      the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.</li><li><strong>Abdominal wall defects.</strong>&nbsp;In these birth defects, the baby&#8217;s intestines or      other abdominal organs stick through the belly button.</li></ul>



<p>The quad screen has traditionally been one of the most
commonly used screenings in the second trimester. It was generally used if
prenatal care began during the second trimester or if first trimester
screening, which involves a blood test and an ultrasound exam, wasn&#8217;t
available.</p>



<p>A negative quad screen doesn&#8217;t guarantee that the baby won&#8217;t
have a chromosomal abnormality, single-gene disorder or certain birth defects.
If your screening test is positive, your doctor will recommend additional
testing to make a diagnosis.</p>



<p>Before the screening, think about what the results mean to
you. Consider whether the screening will be worth any anxiety it might cause,
or whether you&#8217;ll handle your pregnancy differently depending on the results. </p>



<p><strong>When should a Quad screen be done?</strong></p>



<p>The Quad screen may be offered to the expectant mother by
the obstetrician/gynaecologist between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, counting
from the first day of the last menstrual period.</p>



<p><strong>How is a Quad screen &nbsp;it done?</strong></p>



<p>You can eat and drink normally before the test.</p>



<p>During the Quad screen test, a sample of blood is taken from the woman&#8217;s vein. The blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis. </p>



<p>You can return to your usual activities immediately.</p>



<p>Substances in the blood sample are measured to screen for:</p>



<ul><li>Problems in the development of the fetus&#8217; brain, spinal cord and other neural tissues of the central nervous system (neural tube). Problems with neural tube development can occur as spina bifida or anencephaly (absence of all or part of the brain). Neural tube defects occur in 1 or 2 out of every 1000 births. The quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% of open neural tube defects.</li><li>Genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality. Approximately 1 in 720 babies is born with Down syndrome. The quad marker screen can detect approximately 75% of Down syndrome cases in women under age 35 and 85 to 90% of Down syndrome cases in women age 35 years and older.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Do I need to have the Quad screen test?</strong></p>



<p>All pregnant women are recommended to have a quad marker screen, but it is your decision whether or not to have the test. However, if you have any of the following risk factors, you may want to strongly consider having the test:</p>



<ul><li>You are age 35 or older when the baby is due.</li><li>Your family has a history of birth defects.</li><li>You&#8217;ve had a child with a previous birth defect.</li><li>You have had insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes prior to your pregnancy.</li></ul>



<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this test,
please talk with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>



<p>The quad screen is a routine prenatal screening test. The test poses no risk of miscarriage or other pregnancy complications.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>Your age and results of the quad screen will be used at the estimated time of delivery to evaluate your chance of carrying a baby who has certain chromosomal conditions, neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects.</p>



<p><strong>Factors that can affect the substances measured by a quad screen include:</strong></p>



<ul><li>A  miscalculation of how long you&#8217;ve been pregnant</li><li>Maternal race</li><li>Maternal  weight</li><li>Carrying  more than one baby during a pregnancy</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>In vitro fertilization</li><li>Smoking  during pregnancy</li></ul>



<p>The quad screen correctly identifies about 80 percent of
women who are carrying a baby who has Down syndrome. The quad screen only indicates your overall chance of
carrying a baby who has certain chromosomal conditions, neural tube defects or
abdominal wall defects. A decreased chance (negative screen result) doesn&#8217;t
guarantee that your baby won&#8217;t have one of these conditions. Likewise, an
increased chance (positive screen result) doesn&#8217;t guarantee that your baby will
be born with one of these conditions.The doctor will help you understand your test results and
what the results might mean for your pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>What it looks for</strong></p>



<ul><li>Down syndrome</li><li>Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome)</li><li>Open Neural Tube Defects (ONTD)</li></ul>



<p><strong>When to do it</strong></p>



<ul><li>15

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Therapeutic Apheresis is a medical technology in which the blood of a person is passed through an apparatus that separates out one particular blood constituent and returns the blood remainder to the circulation. It selectively removes cells or other targeted abnormal substances from the blood circulation; it is used for the treatment of conditions in which a pathogenic substance or component in the blood is causing morbidity. One of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<br> Blood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during blood donation, where the needed component is collected and the &#8220;unused&#8221; components are returned to the donor.</p>



<p style="text-align:left"><strong>How do we perform Therapeutic Apheresis?</strong><br></p>



<p> Therapeutic Apheresis is performed using a machine called a Blood Cell Separator which can separate blood into its various parts. The machine separates and removes the portion of your blood depending on the type of Apheresis you will be undergoing and gives you<br> back replacement red cells, plasma or other fluids as the case may be. The remaining part of your blood, including red cells, white cells and/or plasma, will be returned to you unaltered during the treatment. A specified component is retained and the remainder is<br> returned to the individual. </p>



<p>All apheresis procedures have the same basic principles in common – blood is withdrawn from a patient through a needle or catheter and mixed with an anticoagulant (citrate) to prevent clotting.&nbsp; The blood is then separated in a centrifuge and the target blood components (based on the procedure being performed) are collected and discarded.&nbsp; The remaining blood is then returned to the patient along with replacement fluids / solutions. </p>



<p>Replacement fluids are given as ordered by the consultant and may include normal saline 0.9%, albumin, red blood cells, and plasma.&nbsp; All materials coming in contact with the patient’s blood are sterile, used only once and discarded.</p>



<p>Parapheresis consists of the following procedures:-</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plasmapheresis</strong> / Plasma exchange: the removal of plasma (the liquid portion of the blood) from a patient and replacement with a solution mixed into the cellular portion of the blood.&nbsp; The replacement may be donor plasma, 5% albumin, and / or normal saline.</li><li><strong>Erythrocytapheresis</strong> / red cell exchange: the removal of a predetermined volume of red blood cells and transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells with reinfusion of the patient’s other blood cells components</li><li><strong>Erythrocytapheresis</strong> / red cells depletion: the removal of a predetermined volume of red blood cells</li><li>Erythrocytapheresis / <strong>Red cell depletion exchange</strong>: red cell depletion immediately followed by red cell exchange</li><li><strong>Leukapheresis</strong>: the removal of white blood cells</li><li><strong>Plateletpheresis</strong>: the removal of platelets</li></ul>



<p><strong>Side effects of Therapeutic Apheresis</strong></p>



<p>The side effects of parapheresis include, but are not
limited to the following:</p>



<ul><li>Weakness or feeling faint as a result
of anxiety or changes in blood pressure or blood volume</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Loss of red blood cells which may
occur if the procedure must be discontinued for any reason (e.g. raised body
temperature of more than 1 degree celsius above baseline)</li><li>Itching and hives and /or tingling of
the lips and/or fingers due to a reaction to the anticoagulant</li><li>Haemolysis: there is a remote
possibility of disrupting the red blood cells due to a malfunction of the
machine; however, this is extremely rare and is carefully monitored.&nbsp; In the event of haemolysis, the procedure is
discontinued.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Please inform the caregiver if any of these occur, as there are adjustments and treatment that can be made to lessen these side effects</strong>;</p>



<p>Although very rare, air infusion, bacterial
contamination, and/or blood transfusion reactions could occur. The consequences
of these unlikely events could be severe and result in death.&nbsp; Complications associated with transfusions of
blood components may include:</p>



<ul><li>Fatal haemolytic transfusion reactions caused by administration of incompatible blood</li><li>Transmission of infectious diseases or agents such as hepatitis, HIV, bacteria or those causing malaria and other rare diseases</li><li>Alloimmunization: the production of antibodies against donor red blood cells, white blood cells or platelet antigens</li><li>Allergic reactions, febrile reactions, lung injury and circulatory overload may also occur.</li></ul>
